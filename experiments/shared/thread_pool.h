// thread can synchronize on. When the caller notices an event, it triggers the
// thread affected by the event. Each thread can only be triggered once.
//
// Example:
// ThreadTrigger triggers_(/*num_threads=*/5);
// ...
// Thread with SID 2: CHECK(!triggers_.Triggered(/*sid=*/2));
// Thread with SID 2: triggers_.WaitForTrigger(/*sid=*/2);
// Caller: /* Writes memory. */
// Caller: triggers_.Trigger(/*sid=*/2);
// (Thread with SID 2 wakes up and returns from `WaitForTrigger()`.).
// Thread with SID 2: CHECK(triggers_.Triggered(/*sid=*/2));
// Thread with SID 2: /* Reads memory written to by `Caller`. */
