"""Runs the RocksDB Shenango experiments.

This script runs the RocksDB Shenango experiments on ghOSt and on CFS. In these
experiments, RocksDB is co-located with an Antagonist. Specifically, the
dispatcher and worker threads are co-located with the Antagonist threads while
the load generator is isolated on its own CPU (to ensure that the load we think
we are generating is the load we are actually generating). For ghOSt, the
Antagonist threads are preempted to allow RocksDB threads to run. For CFS, this
preemption is left to CFS to figure out. Furthermore, for the CFS experiments,
the worker threads sleep on a futex when they do not have work rather than spin
so that CFS gives the Antagonist threads a chance to run.
