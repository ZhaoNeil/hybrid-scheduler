/*
 * A task's fair share of a multiprocessor at an instant 't' is the nr_cpus /
 * runnable load. ('running' counts as runnable).
 *
 *      f(t) = nr_cpus / runnable_load
 *
 * But what if we want a weighted fair share?  Load is a function of the
 * specific runnables at time t:
 *
 *      f(t) = nr_cpus / wl(p0, p1, p2, ...)
 *
 * When we calculate Weighted Load, we weight each runnable task (p_i) according
 * to its weight w_i.
 *
 *      wl = w0 + w1 + ...
 *
 * wl() depends on t, since the runnable load varies over time, i.e. based on
 * which tasks have woken up.  Let's call it wl(t).
 *
 * A task's share of that wl is: w_x / wl.  Thus a runnable task X's share of
 * the multiprocessor (at time t) is:
 *
 *      f(t, p_x) = nr_cpus * w_x / wl(t)
 *
 * If all the weights = 1, that's: nr_cpus / nr_runnables
 *
 *
 * A task's fair share of the machine might be more than one cpu.  But a Linux
 * task can only run on one cpu at a time.
 *
 *      f(t, p_x) = min(1, nr_cpus * w_x / wl(t))
 *
 * A task's fair share over a window of time is the integral of f(t); consider
 * tiny time slices of 't': we calculate the integral by Sum(f(t_0) * delta_t)
 * over the window.  This F(t)'s units are cpu-seconds.
 *
 * What window(s) do we pick?  For a given task, the windows are when it is
 * runnable.  If a task is asleep, it doesn't count.  Over the length of time of
 * the entire trace, we can compute a task's fair share (from when it was
 * runnable) as well as how much it actually ran.
 *
 * The min() is important here.  For a delta_t, we don't want to accumulate more
 * share than a task could possibly use.  Say we have 100 cpus and only one task
 * is running.  If you ignore the min, it's share of the multiprocessor is 100
 * cpus for that time.  Yet it can't run on 100 cpus.  If we later compare how
 * much time the task ran to its share, we'd think it only ran 1% of its share.
 *
 * Ideally, every time t_i any task blocked or woke up, we'd change wl(t) (add
 * or remove the task's weight), and calculate f(t_i, p_x) * (t_i - t_prev) for
 * every task.  That's a O(nr_runnables) on every block/wake event...  Too much.
 *
 * Forget about specific tasks for a moment.  We can maintain a running
 * calculation of F(t) (the integral) on the fly for a given weight.  Then given
 * that weight's F(t), compute the integral of f(x) over a window as
 * F(t_1) - F(t_0).
 *
 * In essence, instead of computing F(t) for every task, we do it for every
 * weight.  Then for a particular task's runnable window, compute:
 *
 * 	p's fair share for the window = F(t_blocked) - F(t_woke)
 *
 * We'll need to do that for every weight, which the user can set up.  We can't
 * just keep a running integral of the total weighted load, since f(t) depends
 * on the min(1, weighted_share).  For now, let's just deal with a single
 * weight.
 *
 * How do we maintain the running calculation of F(t)?  Ideally, every time a
 * task wakes or blocks, that changes the load (wl).  We could (atomically):
 *
 * 	delta_t = now - last_update;
 * 	for each weight_i
 * 		F += f(wl, weight_i) * delta_t;
 * 	wl += delta_wl;
 * 	last_update = now;
 *
 * Thus every time the load changes, f changes, and we accumulate those changes
 * in F.  However, that's a minor pain to do on every wake/block.  BPF has
 * spinlocks, but doing that update and locking on every wakeup/block on every
 * cpu seems like a potential scalability problem.
 *
 * I considered only updating this on timer ticks from cpu0, which would be once
 * per ms.  However, that is too slow.  Tasks that wake and block very quickly,
 * O(10us) will not have their load measured, nor will they perceive any change
 * in F(t).
 *
 * To avoid major scalability problems or issues with spinlocks, we'll use a 
 * lockless "post/poke" style where if we have multiple cpus trying to update F
 * at the same time, only a single thread does the actual update: atomic_add on
 * delta_wl, bool to control if someone is updating F, atomic_swap(delta_wl, 0)
 * to snarf load changes and apply to F.  Threads that don't do the update may
 * end up using an older value of F for their specific task's F(now) - F(then)
 * calc, which is fine.
 *
 * A note on units:
 * 1) When we compute:
 *
 *      f(t, p_x) = min(1, nr_cpus * w_x / wl(t))
 *
 * ideally we want a float (0,1].  Since we're doing integer math, we'd only get
 * 0 or 1.  To fix that, we'll deal with "millicpus": 1000th of a cpu.
 *
 * 2) bpf_ktime_get_us() returns usec.
 *
 * 3) Put together, F(t) (accum_fair_share) is in *millicpu-usec*.  Same goes
 * for ti->total_cpu_runtime and ti->total_cpu_share.  We're not in danger of
 * overflowing the u64 (20 bits for us, 10 for milli, 8 for 256 cpus, etc.)  If
 * you're looking at these raw numbers, 10^9 millicpu-usec is 1 cpu-sec.
